## Installation
- Open Package Manager through Window/Package Manager
- Click "+" and choose "Add package from git URL..."
- Insert the URL: https://github.com/Delt06/di-framework.git?path=Packages/com.deltation.di-framework

## Setting up
- Create a `GameObject` and attach a `Root Dependency Container` component.
- Using the menu of the attached `Root Dependency Container` (or manually), add the other container types. For detailed info on them, refer to the section [Container types](https://github.com/Delt06/di-framework/wiki/Containers).
- Define an injectable component according to the rules described in the section [Injection rules](https://github.com/Delt06/di-framework/wiki/Injection-Rules).
- Attach the created component to a `GameObject` and add a `Resolver` to it. Configure the `Resolver`, if needed: refer to [Resolvers](https://github.com/Delt06/di-framework/wiki/Resolver).

Example:
- Components structure: ![Resolver Example](Screenshots/resolver_example.jpg)
- `Movement.cs`: 
```c#
using UnityEngine;

public sealed class Movement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void Construct(Rigidbody rigidbody)
    {
        _rigidbody = rigidbody;
    }

    private Rigidbody _rigidbody;
}
```
